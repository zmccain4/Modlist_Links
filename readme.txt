The server can be connected to with a vanilla 1.21.11 client. However, it also supports the Fabric modding enviroment.

Below are links to the fabric installer, and some compatible fabric mods:

Fabric Installer - https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/

In the installer, use minecraft version 1.21.11, and loader version 0.18.4. Make sure the launcher location points to the '.minecraft' folder that you regularly use. If you check the 'create profile' option, you can later change the working directory of the profile in the minecraft launcher, to keep it separate from your regular minecraft installation.

Once the fabric installer is finished, you can add any of the following mods to the /mods folder in your minecraft directory.
